    prompt:`There are picture words. And there are connecting words. Here are their definitions: A Picture Word is a word that carries a built-in picture within it.  Like Rose. Tree. Boy. Harry. Hit. Itch. Thump. Blue. Swim. Slowly. Explosion. Truth. And all the rest. Each one of these words carries a picture inside itself. That picture stands out by itself. You need no other words to support it. You can see it. Smell it. Taste it. Touch it. Draw it. Show it on film. And, above all, you can be sure when you say it that the other person sees the same picture too. The most powerful tool of all is the Picture Word which shows us more than one kind of picture. They build punch, charm, and humor into your sentences. A Connecting word has no built-in picture within it. When you say a Connecting Word by itself, you don't see anything. Like a, the, in, over, and, yet, to , when, before, is, was, be. And all the rest. Unless you put them in a sentence, they give you no picture at all. They tell us how the Picture Words are connected.  They sort the Picture Words out for us.

    Brief: Gray's Cookies are the best tasting yet guilt-free pleasure so you can stay in control of your health and mind." It's targeted at suburban working moms, 35-40, who are willing to do whatever it takes to stay healthy. They run, work out and eat right. For many, food can be a stress-reliever and escape even for people who watch what they eat. Once consumers cheat on their diet, it puts their whole willpower at risk. "Once I give in to a cookie, I can't stop myself. They taste too good. It puts my diet at risk of collapsing. I feel so guilty." The main message is that with Gray's Cookies, you can do what you want and stop feeling guilty over eating a damn cookie.

    Brief: The purpose of the ad is to expand Red Bull into the older adult market as a beverage that can give them the focus needed to tackle their deepest desires. The target audience is middle-aged men and women reaching the "midlife crisis" aspect of their lives. They are in need of an internal change and lack the motivation and direction to make it happen. They feel they have wasted away their lives and fear only doom lies ahead. What are the supporting rational and emotional reasons to believe and buy? Red Bull increases performance, increases concentration and reaction speed, improves vigilance, stimulates motivation, and makes you feel more energetic and thus improving your overall well-being. What is the big idea? Get your balls back.

   Let's think step by step how best to understand these two kinds of words and their underlying beliefs and assumptions, and when given a brief which includes the name of a brand, the target audience, the overall message of the ad, and tone of voice, create tv commercials written in any style such as the highly emotional lifestyle branding campaign from Nike. Like these for example:
    #######  
    Product: Give me an ad for Nike Shoes targeting everyday athletes. The tone is motivational.
    Script:
    Title - "Never too far down"
    We've all been underestimated and counted out
    In those moments we felt like it was over
    But it's when we're given no chance
    that we somehow found that last bit of strength to keep fighting
    And then we did what no one thought we could.
    Not even ourselves
    We came back from the impossible
    From being broken
    We're never too far down\
    To come back.
    ######
    Product: Give me an ad for running shoes, Targeting everyday athletes. The tone is deeply emotional.
    Script:
    Title - "Unlimited"
    When we talk about running
    What do we usually think of?
    The finish line
    How many seconds it took to get there
    Our time
    How fast we ran
    Our pace
    How quickly we crossed the line
    But what about the journey
    What about the climb
    The long-distance
    The days and miles to get there
    We're not running because we're done
    We're running to see what's next
    It's because we're not done
    That we can't stop running
    So if you're not done running
    You're not done living
    That's what unlimited is.
    ######
    Product: Give me an ad for Nike Headbands targeting female athletes. The tone is inspirational.
    Script:
    Title - "Dream Crazier"
    If we show emotion
    We're called dramatic
    If we wanna play against men
    We're nuts
    And if we dream of equal opportunity? 
    Delusional
    When we stand for something? 
    We're unhinged
    When we're too good? 
    There's something wrong with us
    So if they wanna call you crazy? 
    Fine
    Show them what you can do
    It's only crazy until you do it
    Dream crazier.

When you say a Picture Word by itself, you see or hear or feel or imagine something. Like Rose. Tree. Boy. Harry. Hit. Itch. Thump. Blue. Swim. Slowly. Explosion. Truth. And all the rest. Each one of these words carries a picture inside itself. That picture stands out by itself. You need no other words to support it. It is there. It exists. You can see it. Smell it. Taste it. Touch it. Draw it. Show it on film. And, above all, you can be sure when you say it that the other person sees the same picture too. The most powerful tool of all is the Picture Word which shows us more than one kind of picture. Once again, every time you write or say a Picture Word you see someÂ­ thing. 
    And the person you're talking to also sees that same thing. Therefore, they are different from our second kind of word . . . the Connecting Word.

  ######
Brief: Give me and ad that excites advertisers about the fact that The Guardian Newspaper is an exciting option for advertisers, especially those who are targeting sports fans.
Copy: the headline reads: "We cannot deny it.  Left Wingers Enjoy the Guardian."  The body copy reads: "It comes as no surprise. A readership so youthful is bound to be a sporting crowd.  Indeed, according to the National Readership Survey, we more all-educate ABC1 readers under 45 that any other quality daily: 342,000. True to form, they dress fashionably and drink stylishly. Better, in fact, than readers of any comparable newspaper. Perhaps they wear well because they lead such active lives.  Among our 1.13 million readers, we can, for instance, count on 125,000 golfers, and 221,000 tennis players. And at least one professional footballer."
  ######
Brief: Give me an ad for the most expensive restaurant in town that wants to advertise to high-end, wealthy clientele
Copy:  The headline reads: "For When Money is No Object". The body copy reads: "Welcome to our world. Here, the finest things in life come at a price - but it's a price we're willing to pay. Because when you have the means, why not enjoy the very best?  Our menu features only the most exotic and luxurious dishes, prepared by our team of Michelin-starred chefs using only the freshest ingredients sourced from around the world. And for those who like their food with a side of excitement, we also offer an extensive wine list featuring some of the rarest vintages in existence. So whether you're looking to indulge your senses or impress business associates, there's no better place than here."
######
Brief: Give me an ad for The Woman's Day magazine who wants to bring awareness to the fact that many baby animals are killed each year in various rituals across the world. They want to support Greenpeace's efforts to stop these atrocities.
Copy:  The headline reads: "How to Kill a Baby". The body copy reads: "It's easy. All you do is walk up to it. It won't run away. Then, as it looks up at you trustingly mistaking you for its mother, you smash in its skull with a baseball bat.  That's what happens to baby seals in Canada every year in a bloody ritual that lasts six weeks. In Japan, they do it a different way. They herd dolphins into the shallows, waiting for the tide to leave them stranded, then go through the same grisly process. Then there's the whales. You know what happens to them. Doing it is dead easy if your mind is warped enough. Stopping it is a whole lot harder, but there is something you can do. In this week's Woman's Day, we're running a thought-provoking article on what's happening to these beautiful creatures. We're also running a simple competition that you and your children can enter. All you have to do is tell us in less than twenty words, what the seals, the dolphins, and the whales would say if they could speak. There are cash prizes, but far more importantly, for every entry in the competition, Woman's Day will donate 10 cents to Greenpeace to help their work in bringing this ghastly business to a halt. Look for this week's Woman's Day. It's the one with the baby seal on the cover, seconds before it dies."

When we want to tell other people our thoughts there are all kinds of Picture Words we can use. There are Picture Words that show us things. There are Picture Words that show us actions. There are Picture Words that show us colors. There are Picture Words that show us size. There are Picture Words that show us details of other picÂ­tures. There are Picture Words that show us feelings. There are Picture Words that show us judgments. There are Picture Words that show us ideas.  And - as the most powerful tool of all - there are Picture Words that show us more than one kind of picture, depending on how they are used in a sentence. Every one of them carries its built-in picture. And they help you transfer that picture from your mind to the mind of someone else. Once again, every time you say one of them, you see someÂ­thing. And the person you're talking to also sees that same thing. Therefore, they are different from our second kind of word . . . the Connecting Word. 
    A Connecting word has no built-in picture within it. When you say a Connecting Word by itself you don't see anything. Like a... the... in... over... and... yet ... to... when... before... is . .. was... be. And all the rest. Unless you put them in a sentence, they give you no picture at all. So what is their use? Very simple. They tell us how the Picture Words go together. They tell us how the Picture Words are connected. In time. In space. In meaning. And in sequence. They put the Picture Words in their correct places. They sort the Picture Words out for us. They arrange them in logical order - with sentences, and between sentences. That's why we call them Connecting Words. A Connecting Word shows us the connection between our Picture Words. To get our meaning precise - to avoid confuÂ­sion when we talk to someone - we need both kinds of words. We need Picture Words. And we need Connecting Words. This artificial general intelligence tool takes the two kinds of words. And learns the best ways to put them together to write novels, poetry, textbooks, busiÂ­ness reports, songs, speeches, humor, satire, allegory, and any other kind of writing. Given a request, this tool writes print advertisements that contains a headline and a picture concept.

    The tagline is the title of a Bob Marley song "Satisfy your soul."
