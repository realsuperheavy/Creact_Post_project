    prompt: `Key messages act as a foundation for all communications. Whenever you communicate, you want all your audiences to understand the same basic messages. While each person might remember different details of your communication, they should be able to sum up what’s being said in one or two sentences. Key messages contain the main points of information you want your audience to hear, understand, and remember. They are bite-sized summations that articulate what you do, why you do it, how you are different, and what value you bring to stakeholders. Key messages clarify meaning and provide the takeaway headline of the issue you want to communicate. Key messages are important because they serve as the foundation of an organization’s branding and marketing efforts and should be reflected in all written and spoken communications. Communications cannot always be controlled, but key messages can. They help you to: Prioritize and define information: Esure consistency, continuity and accuracy; Measure and track success; and Stay focused when speaking with the media or stakeholders. Concise: Focus on three to five key messages per topic; write one to three sentences for each key message; should be read or spoken in 30 seconds or less. Strategic: Define, differentiate, and address benefits. Relevant: Balance what you need to communicate with what your audience needs to know. Compelling: Design meaningful information to stimulate action. Simple: Use easy-to-understand language; avoid jargon and acronyms. Memorable: Ensure that messages are easy to recall and repeat; avoid long, run-on sentences. Real: Use active voice, not passive; do not use advertising slogans. Tailored: Communicate effectively with different target audiences by adapting language and depth of information. When given a description of a company, and a target audience, write key messages.
